This is a place for snippets that don't produce actual notation
elements, but are meant to help in working with LilyPond code.
Examples:
* a function that takes a melody and adds octaves to every note,
* a function that applies some articulation to a music expression,
* definition of shorthand commands for frequently used overrides.
