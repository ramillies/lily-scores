    When writing down harmonization of a piece, sometimes there are places
    where a chord changes to some other just for a brief moment, so that playing
    it as a separate chord on the accompanying instrument is optional.
    This little function is for printing such chords in smaller font and parenthesized.
  }
  % add comma-separated tags to make searching more effective:
  tags = "chord, parenthesize, small"
