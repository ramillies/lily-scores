A place for collections of user-designed layout settings.
Have you found a combination of settings that works well
for a particular type of music?  Place it here.

Have you desgined a custom header layout?  Place it here.

Do you use a "house style" for all your scores?  Place it
here!

If it turns out that some settings are used repeatedly by
majority of users, maybe we will make them the default in
LilyPond.
