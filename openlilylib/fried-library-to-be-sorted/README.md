What's this?
------------

Functions, stylesheets and other stuff from the library of
["Oskar Fried: Complete Songs" project]
(http://lilypondblog.org/2013/10/oskar-fried-complete-songs/)

This is quite chaotic, as i just copied stuff from our library subdir,
removing unwanted stuff but without doing thorough cleanup.  It should
be formatted accodrdingly to openlilylib/snippets conventions, files
renamed appropriately and put in appropriate subdirectories.

Every file contains a TODO explaining in more detail what should be done.
Pull requests welcome!
